This repository applies the following methods:

> * Box-Cox Transform to rectify the distrubtion of the data 
> * Cyclic and relative datetime encodings 
> * Deep Learning forecasting method, such as the Temporal Fusion Transformer
> * All deep learning models are publically available @ [wandb model training](https://wandb.ai/nikolaushouben/load_forecasting_lbl)

Furthermore, new data has been introduced to discuss the differnces in forecasting approaches for electricity load on various spatial and temporal scales.

> * Disaggregated Single-Family Home Electricity Load Data [Schlemminger et al. 2022](https://zenodo.org/record/5642902#.ZBjEVcLMIuU)
> * Aggregated Neighborhood-level

The forecasts in this repo were generated with the [darts](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/README.html), [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), and dmlc [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai/) and experiment tracking was performed with [weights & biases](https://wandb.ai/site).
